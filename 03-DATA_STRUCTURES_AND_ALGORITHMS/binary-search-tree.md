# BINARY SEARCH TREE PROJECT


Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.


[7,5,1,8,3,6,0,9,4,2]


[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

The root is selected as 4. Left subtree of the root consist of numbers less than the root and right subtree of the root consist of numbers greater than the root.
